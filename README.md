# Journey Into the Light
Experience an immersive RPG-style adventure mod that doesn't stray too far from Vanilla's roots.


Journey Into The Light (or "Journey" for short), formerly known as Essence of the Gods, is a large exploration mod that not only expands the vanilla content added - but also adds 7 new dimensions, over one hundred mobs, strong weapons and armor, and much more.
